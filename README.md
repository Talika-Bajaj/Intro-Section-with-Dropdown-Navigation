# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 39th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

I completed a Frontend Mentor challenge focused on building an intro section with a dropdown navigation menu. This project tested my skills in creating responsive dropdown menus using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a common feature in larger websites. It also presented a great opportunity to tackle basic layout challenges, improving my ability to design interactive and structured web pages.


**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
